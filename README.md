Project: FloraCart E-commerce Flower and Gifts Store

FloraCart E-commerce Flower and Gifts Store, a web-based platform developed to make flower and gift shopping simple and convenient. This application allows users to browse different categories of flowers and gifts, check product details, view prices, and place orders online. The system provides a clean and user-friendly interface for smooth navigation and secure transactions. FloraCart is designed to offer a reliable and efficient online shopping experience for customers.

Step 1: Project Overview and System Setup

Before running the project, ensure that Node.js and MongoDB are installed on your system. The project follows a client-server architecture where the frontend handles user interaction and the backend manages business logic and database operations. Proper installation of required software ensures smooth working of the application.

Step 2: System Architecture

The application is divided into two main parts:

Frontend: Displays flower collections, gift items, product details, and shopping cart options.

Backend: Handles user authentication, order management, and database communication.

The frontend sends requests to backend APIs, and the backend stores and retrieves data from the database.

Step 3: Database Configuration

MongoDB is used to store product details, prices, customer information, and order history. The database connection must be configured properly in the backend settings file for correct data management.
