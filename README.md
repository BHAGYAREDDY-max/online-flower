 Project: FloraCart E-commerce Flower and Gifts Store



Before running the project, ensure that Node.js and MongoDB are installed on your system. The project follows a client-server architecture where the frontend handles user interaction and the backend manages business logic and database operations. Proper installation of required software ensures smooth working of the application.

Step 2: System Architecture

The application is divided into two main parts:

Frontend: Displays flower collections, gift items, product details, and shopping cart options.

Backend: Handles user authentication, order management, and database communication.

The frontend sends requests to backend APIs, and the backend stores and retrieves data from the database.

Step 3: Database Configuration

MongoDB is used to store product details, prices, customer information, and order history. The database connection must be configured properly in the backend settings file for correct data management.

Step 4: Functional Modules

The project includes the following features:
